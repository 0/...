xmonad/lib
==========

Why are these here instead of as part of some proper libraries?

Too small to survive on its own.

XMonad.Actions.CycleWS
----------------------

No released version of xmonad has ``CycleWS`` with ``WorkspaceHistory``
support.

XMonad.Hooks.WorkspaceHistory
-----------------------------

No released version of xmonad has ``WorkspaceHistory``.

XMonad.Layout.CompactName
-------------------------

Doesn't sound useful enough to bother adding it to xmonad-contrib.
